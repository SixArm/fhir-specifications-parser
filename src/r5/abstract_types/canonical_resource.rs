    /// # url
    /// 
    /// ## Description
    /// 
    /// The `url` attribute represents the canonical URL that uniquely
    /// identifies a FHIR resource such as a StructureDefinition, ValueSet,
    /// CodeSystem, or CapabilityStatement. This URL serves as a global
    /// identifier that remains constant across different versions of the
    /// resource and provides a stable reference for external systems to
    /// identify and reference the resource.
    /// 
    /// ## Purpose
    /// 
    /// The `url` exists to provide a globally unique, version-independent
    /// identifier for FHIR resources. This enables:
    /// 
    /// - Stable referencing of resources across different FHIR implementations
    /// - Version management while maintaining resource identity
    /// - Canonical identification for resource dependencies and imports  
    /// - Support for resource discovery and resolution mechanisms
    /// - Consistent resource identification in distributed healthcare networks
    /// 
    /// ## Usage
    /// 
    /// Use the `url` attribute when:
    /// 
    /// - Defining canonical resources like StructureDefinitions, ValueSets, or
    ///   CodeSystems
    /// - Creating stable references that persist across resource versions
    /// - Implementing resource registries or repositories
    /// - Supporting resource discovery and dependency resolution
    /// - Establishing canonical URLs for organizational FHIR artifacts
    /// 
    /// The `url` should follow URI format conventions and be resolvable when
    /// possible to aid in resource discovery.
    /// 
    /// ## Data Type
    /// 
    /// **uri** - A Uniform Resource Identifier following RFC 3986:
    /// - Must be an absolute URI with scheme (typically http or https)
    /// - Should be unique globally to avoid conflicts
    /// - Recommended to use organization's domain for uniqueness
    /// - May include path components to organize related resources
    /// - Should remain stable even as resource content evolves
    /// 
    /// ## Constraints
    /// 
    /// - **Required**: Yes for canonical resources (StructureDefinition,
    ///   ValueSet, CodeSystem, etc.)
    /// - **Cardinality**: 1..1 (exactly one occurrence when present)
    /// - **Format**: Must be a valid absolute URI
    /// - **Uniqueness**: Should be globally unique within the resource type
    /// - **Stability**: Should remain constant across resource versions
    /// - **Resolvability**: Should ideally be resolvable to the actual resource
    /// 
    /// ## Examples
    /// 
    /// See the accompanying `example.json` file for a complete
    /// StructureDefinition resource demonstrating the canonical URL usage in
    /// various contexts.
    /// 
    /// ## Related Keys
    ///

    /// 
    /// ## Description
    /// 
    /// The `version` attribute represents the business version identifier of a
    /// FHIR resource, particularly for canonical resources like
    /// StructureDefinitions, ValueSets, CodeSystems, and CapabilityStatements.
    /// This version works in conjunction with the canonical `url` to provide
    /// precise, version-specific identification of resources. Unlike technical
    /// versioning (like `meta.versionId`), the business version reflects
    /// meaningful changes in the resource's content, semantics, or clinical
    /// significance.
    /// 
    /// ## Purpose
    /// 
    /// The `version` exists to support:
    /// 
    /// - Business-level versioning that reflects meaningful content changes
    /// - Version-specific resource references and dependencies
    /// - Change management and compatibility tracking across resource evolution
    /// - Support for multiple concurrent versions of the same conceptual
    ///   resource
    /// - Implementation guidance for version compatibility and migration
    /// - Regulatory and compliance requirements for versioned healthcare
    ///   standards
    /// 
    /// ## Usage
    /// 
    /// Use the `version` attribute when:
    /// 
    /// - Publishing canonical resources that may evolve over time
    /// - Supporting multiple concurrent versions of clinical standards
    /// - Implementing version-aware resource resolution and validation
    /// - Managing dependencies between versioned FHIR artifacts
    /// - Providing clear change tracking for clinical decision support rules
    /// - Supporting regulatory requirements for versioned healthcare content
    /// 
    /// Version values should follow semantic versioning principles where
    /// appropriate, using formats like "1.0.0" or "2024.1" depending on
    /// organizational conventions.
    /// 
    /// ## Data Type
    /// 
    /// **string** - A human-readable version identifier:
    /// 
    /// - Commonly follows semantic versioning (e.g., "1.0.0", "2.1.3")
    /// - May use date-based versioning (e.g., "2024.08", "20240815")
    /// - Can include pre-release indicators (e.g., "1.0.0-beta", "2.0.0-rc1")
    /// - Should be consistently formatted within an organization
    /// - Must be comparable to determine version precedence
    /// - Should reflect the significance of changes between versions
    /// 
    /// ## Constraints
    /// 
    /// - **Required**: Optional for most resources, strongly recommended for
    ///   canonical resources
    /// - **Cardinality**: 0..1 (at most one occurrence)
    /// - **Format**: No strict format requirements, but should be consistent
    ///   and comparable
    /// - **Uniqueness**: Should be unique within the context of the same
    ///   canonical URL
    /// - **Ordering**: Should allow for logical ordering and comparison of
    ///   versions
    /// - **Stability**: Should not change once a version is published and in
    ///   use
    /// 
    /// ## Examples
    /// 
    /// See the accompanying `example.json` file for complete examples
    /// demonstrating version usage in StructureDefinition, ValueSet, and
    /// CapabilityStatement resources with different versioning approaches.
    ///

    /// 
    /// ## Description
    /// 
    /// The `contact` attribute provides contact information for individuals or
    /// organizations associated with a FHIR resource. This includes names,
    /// roles, telecommunications details (phone, email, fax), and other means
    /// of communication. In canonical resources like StructureDefinitions and
    /// ValueSets, contact information typically identifies maintainers,
    /// authors, or support personnel who can provide assistance with the
    /// resource. In clinical resources, it may represent care team members,
    /// emergency contacts, or administrative contacts.
    /// 
    /// ## Purpose
    /// 
    /// The `contact` exists to:
    /// 
    /// - Provide communication channels for resource maintainers and support
    ///   personnel
    /// - Enable stakeholder identification for canonical resources and
    ///   implementation guides  
    /// - Support collaboration and feedback mechanisms for FHIR artifacts
    /// - Facilitate clinical communication for patient care coordination
    /// - Enable emergency contact information for patients and care scenarios
    /// - Provide organizational contact points for administrative and business
    ///   processes
    /// - Support regulatory and compliance communication requirements
    /// 
    /// ## Usage
    ///

    ///   identification
    /// - Creating implementation guides with support contact information
    /// - Managing patient emergency contacts and care team communication
    /// - Establishing organizational contact points for business relationships
    /// - Supporting regulatory submissions that require contact information
    /// - Enabling collaboration on FHIR artifacts and clinical content
    /// - Providing support channels for users of FHIR resources and systems
    /// 
    /// Contact information should be current, accurate, and appropriate for the
    /// intended use.
    /// 
    /// ## Data Type
    ///
