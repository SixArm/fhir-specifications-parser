    /// 
    /// ## Description
    /// 
    /// The `resourceType` attribute specifies the type of FHIR resource being
    /// represented. It is a mandatory element that identifies which resource
    /// schema and constraints apply to the JSON document in FHIR R5.
    /// 
    /// ## Purpose
    /// 
    /// The `resourceType` serves several critical functions:
    /// 
    /// - Identifies the specific FHIR resource type for parsers and processors
    /// - Determines which validation rules and constraints apply
    /// - Enables proper routing and processing in FHIR systems
    /// - Provides context for interpreting the resource's data elements
    /// - Supports polymorphism in FHIR resource handling
    /// 
    /// ## Usage
    /// 
    /// The `resourceType` must be included in every FHIR resource as the first
    /// element. It should be used:
    /// 
    /// - At the root level of every FHIR resource JSON document
    /// - When validating resources against their appropriate
    ///   StructureDefinitions
    /// - In API endpoints to determine resource-specific processing logic
    /// - For content negotiation and resource type filtering
    /// 
    /// ## Data Type
    /// 
    /// **code** - A string that must exactly match one of the defined FHIR
    /// resource types. The value is:
    /// 
    /// - Case-sensitive
    /// - Must be an exact match to a valid FHIR R5 resource type name
    /// - Follows PascalCase naming convention (e.g., "Patient", "Observation",
    ///   "DiagnosticReport")
    /// 
    /// ## Constraints
    /// 
    /// - **Required**: Yes - Must be present in every FHIR resource
    /// - **Cardinality**: 1..1 (exactly one occurrence)
    /// - **Fixed Position**: Must be the first element in the JSON object
    /// - **Valid Values**: Must be one of the 150+ defined FHIR R5 resource

    /// 
    /// ## Description
    /// 
    /// The `title` attribute provides a human-readable, descriptive name for a
    /// FHIR resource that is intended for display to end users. Unlike the
    /// `name` attribute which is machine-readable and constrained to specific
    /// naming conventions, the `title` serves as a user-friendly label that can
    /// include spaces, punctuation, and formatting that makes it more
    /// accessible to healthcare professionals and patients.
    /// 
    /// ## Purpose
    /// 
    /// The `title` exists to provide a clear, descriptive display name that:
    ///

    /// # purpose
    /// 
    /// ## Description
    /// 
    /// The `purpose` attribute provides an explanation of why a FHIR resource
    /// exists and what it is intended to accomplish. This element goes beyond
    /// the technical description to articulate the clinical, business, or
    /// regulatory rationale for the resource's creation and use. The purpose
    /// helps implementers understand the intended context and appropriate
    /// applications for the resource, supporting better decision-making about
    /// adoption and implementation.
    /// 
    /// ## Purpose
    /// 
    /// The `purpose` exists to:
    /// 
    /// - Explain the rationale and intended use cases for FHIR resources
    /// - Provide context for implementers to understand appropriate
    ///   applications
    /// - Support decision-making about resource adoption and implementation
    /// - Document regulatory or business requirements that drove resource
    ///   creation
    /// - Enable better resource discovery and selection for specific use cases
    /// - Facilitate understanding of resource scope and boundaries
    /// - Support governance and compliance requirements for resource usage
    /// 
    /// ## Usage
    /// 
    /// Use the `purpose` attribute when:
    /// 
    /// - Publishing canonical resources like StructureDefinitions, ValueSets,
    ///   or CodeSystems
    /// - Creating implementation guides that need clear use case documentation
    /// - Supporting regulatory submissions that require rationale documentation
    /// - Enabling resource discovery and selection processes
    /// - Providing guidance for implementers about appropriate resource usage
    /// - Documenting business or clinical requirements that justify resource
    ///   creation
    /// - Supporting governance processes that require purpose documentation
    /// 
    /// The purpose should be clear, concise, and focused on the "why" rather
    /// than the "what" or "how".
    /// 
    /// ## Data Type
    /// 
    /// **markdown** - Formatted text supporting Markdown syntax:
    /// 
    /// - Supports rich text formatting including lists, emphasis, and links
    /// - Should be concise but comprehensive enough to explain the rationale
    /// - May include references to regulatory requirements or clinical
    ///   guidelines
    /// - Can use formatting to improve readability and organization
    /// - Should avoid overly technical jargon when possible
    /// - May include examples or scenarios to illustrate intended use
    /// 
    /// ## Constraints
    /// 
    /// - **Required**: Optional but strongly recommended for canonical
    ///   resources
    /// - **Cardinality**: 0..1 (at most one purpose statement per resource)
    /// - **Length**: Should be substantial enough to explain rationale but
    ///   concise for readability
    /// - **Format**: Markdown text that renders appropriately in documentation
    ///   systems
    /// - **Language**: Should match the language specified in the resource
    /// - **Clarity**: Should be understandable to the target audience of
    ///   implementers
    /// - **Accuracy**: Should accurately reflect the actual intended use and
    ///   rationale
    /// 
    /// ## Examples
    /// 
    /// See the accompanying `example.json` file for complete resources
    /// demonstrating purpose usage in various FHIR resources including
    /// StructureDefinitions, ValueSets, and ImplementationGuides with clear
    /// rationale statements.
    /// 
    /// ## Related Keys
    /// 
    /// - `description` - Technical description that complements the purpose
    ///   with "what" information
    /// - `title` - Human-readable name that should align with the stated
    ///   purpose
    /// - `useContext` - Specific contexts where the resource applies,
    ///   supporting the purpose
    /// - `jurisdiction` - Geographic or organizational scope related to the
    ///   purpose
    /// - `copyright` - Legal context that may relate to the purpose and
    ///   intended use
    /// - `publisher` - Organization responsible for the resource, often related
    ///   to the purpose
    /// - `status` - Current status that indicates readiness for the stated
    ///   purpose
