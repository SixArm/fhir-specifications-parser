    /// 
    /// ## Description
    /// 
    /// The `valueSet` attribute references another ValueSet resource to include
    /// or exclude its contents in the current ValueSet composition. It enables
    /// modular value set construction by allowing one value set to incorporate
    /// concepts from other value sets, supporting reusable terminology building
    /// blocks and hierarchical value set organization. This promotes
    /// consistency and reduces duplication across related value sets.
    /// 
    /// ## Purpose
    /// 
    /// The `valueSet` exists to enable modular value set composition that
    /// supports:
    /// 
    /// - Reusable terminology building blocks and components
    /// - Hierarchical organization of related value sets
    /// - Consistent concept grouping across multiple value sets
    /// - Reduced maintenance overhead through shared components
    /// - Flexible composition patterns for complex terminology requirements
    /// - Support for organizational and domain-specific value set libraries
    /// 
    /// ## Usage
    /// 
    /// Use the `valueSet` attribute when:
    /// 
    /// - Including concepts from other value sets in your composition
    /// - Building hierarchical value set structures
    /// - Creating modular terminology components for reuse
    /// - Excluding concepts that are defined in other value sets
    /// - Implementing organizational value set inheritance patterns
    /// - Supporting complex terminology requirements through composition
    /// 
    /// ValueSet references are resolved during expansion to incorporate the
    /// referenced concepts.
    /// 
    /// ## Data Type
    /// 
    /// **canonical** - A canonical URL reference to another ValueSet resource:
    /// 
    /// - Must be a valid canonical URL format
    /// - Should resolve to an accessible ValueSet resource
    /// - May include version information using the |version syntax
    /// - Can reference value sets in the same system or external systems
    /// 
    /// ## Constraints
    /// 
    /// - **Required**: URI is required when valueSet is present
    /// - **Cardinality**: 0..* (zero to many occurrences within
    ///   include/exclude)
    /// - **Resolution**: Referenced value sets must be resolvable during
    ///   expansion
    /// - **Circular References**: Must not create circular reference patterns
    /// - **Version Consistency**: Version references should align with
    ///   available versions
    /// - **Access**: Referenced value sets must be accessible to the
    ///   terminology server
    /// 
    /// ## Examples
    /// 
    /// See the accompanying `example.json` file for a complete ValueSet
    /// resource demonstrating the `valueSet` attribute with multiple
    /// references, versioned references, and modular composition patterns.

    /// item beyond what a simple name or title can convey.
    /// 
    /// ## Purpose

    /// - Detailed explanation of resource purpose and functionality
    /// - Clear guidance on proper usage and implementation
    /// - Documentation of constraints, limitations, and special considerations
    /// - Support for user understanding and decision-making

    /// 
    /// ## Description
    /// 
    /// The `extension` attribute provides a mechanism for extending FHIR
    /// resources with additional data elements that are not part of the base
    /// resource definition. Extensions allow for local customizations and the
    /// addition of new data elements while maintaining interoperability in FHIR
    /// R5.
    /// 
    /// ## Purpose
    /// 
    /// Extensions exist to:
    /// 
    /// - Add data elements not covered by the base FHIR specification
    /// - Support local, regional, or national requirements
    /// - Enable gradual evolution of FHIR without breaking existing
    ///   implementations
    /// - Maintain semantic interoperability through standardized extension
    ///   definitions
    /// - Allow for experimental or emerging data requirements
    /// - Support backwards compatibility when new elements are added to FHIR
    /// 
    /// ## Usage
    /// 
    /// Use extensions when you need to:
    /// 
    /// - Include additional data not supported by standard FHIR elements
    /// - Implement local business requirements
    /// - Support regulatory or compliance requirements
    /// - Add experimental data elements before they become part of core FHIR
    /// - Extend resources with organization-specific information
    /// 
    /// Extensions should always reference a StructureDefinition that defines
    /// their meaning and constraints.
    /// 
    /// ## Data Type
    /// 
    /// **Extension** - A complex data type containing:
    /// 
    /// - `url` (required): canonical URI identifying the extension definition
    /// - `value[x]` (optional): the actual extension value using one of the
    ///   allowed FHIR data types
    /// - `extension` (optional): nested extensions for complex extension
    ///   structures
    /// 
    /// Extensions can be simple (single value) or complex (containing nested
    /// extensions).
    /// 
    /// ## Constraints
    /// 
    /// - **Required**: No - Extensions are always optional
    /// - **Cardinality**: 0..* (zero to many occurrences)
    /// - **URL Required**: Every extension must have a `url` that references
    ///   its definition
    /// - **Value or Nested**: Extensions must have either a value or nested
    ///   extensions, not both
    /// - **Definition**: The URL must reference a valid StructureDefinition of
    ///   type Extension
    /// - **Placement**: Can appear on any element that allows extensions
    /// 
    /// ## Examples
    /// 
    /// See the accompanying `example.json` file for a complete Patient resource
    /// demonstrating various types of extensions including simple value
    /// extensions and complex nested extensions.

    /// # additional
    /// 
    /// ## Description
    /// 
    /// The `additional` property defines additional search parameters that can
    /// be used when searching within a specific resource compartment. It
    /// extends the basic search capabilities with resource-specific parameters
    /// that are meaningful for that compartment context.
    /// 
    /// ## Purpose
    /// 
    /// - Specify compartment-specific search parameters beyond standard ones
    /// - Enable more refined searches within resource compartments
    /// - Provide resource-type-aware search capabilities
    /// - Support specialized search patterns for different FHIR resources
    /// 
    /// ## Usage
    /// 
    /// The `additional` property is used within CompartmentDefinition resources
    /// to specify extra search parameters that are available when searching for
    /// resources within that compartment. These parameters supplement the
    /// standard search parameters.
    /// 
    /// ## Data Type
    /// 
    /// **array** of **string** - Each string represents a search parameter name
    /// that is additionally supported for the compartment
    /// 
    /// ## Constraints
    /// 
    /// - Must be an array of valid search parameter names
    /// - Search parameters must be defined and supported by the server
    /// - Parameters should be relevant to the compartment context
    /// - Empty array is valid if no additional parameters are needed
