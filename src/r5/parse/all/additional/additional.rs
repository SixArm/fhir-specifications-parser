//! # additional
//! 
//! ## Description
//! 
//! The `additional` property defines additional search parameters that can be
//! used when searching within a specific resource compartment. It extends the
//! basic search capabilities with resource-specific parameters that are
//! meaningful for that compartment context.
//! 
//! ## Purpose
//! 
//! - Specify compartment-specific search parameters beyond standard ones
//! - Enable more refined searches within resource compartments
//! - Provide resource-type-aware search capabilities
//! - Support specialized search patterns for different FHIR resources
//! 
//! ## Usage
//! 
//! The `additional` property is used within CompartmentDefinition resources to
//! specify extra search parameters that are available when searching for
//! resources within that compartment. These parameters supplement the standard
//! search parameters.
//! 
//! ## Data Type
//! 
//! **array** of **string** - Each string represents a search parameter name
//! that is additionally supported for the compartment
//! 
//! ## Constraints
//! 
//! - Must be an array of valid search parameter names
//! - Search parameters must be defined and supported by the server
//! - Parameters should be relevant to the compartment context
//! - Empty array is valid if no additional parameters are needed
//! 
//! ## Examples
//! 
//! ### Patient Compartment with Additional Search Parameters
//! 
//! ```json
//! {
//!   "resourceType": "CompartmentDefinition",
//!   "resource": [
//!     {
//!       "code": "Observation",
//!       "param": ["subject", "patient"],
//!       "additional": ["category", "code", "value-concept"]
//!     }
//!   ]
//! }
//! ```
//! 
//! ### Encounter Compartment with Additional Parameters
//! 
//! ```json
//! {
//!   "resource": [
//!     {
//!       "code": "DiagnosticReport", 
//!       "param": ["encounter"],
//!       "additional": ["status", "category", "date"]
//!     }
//!   ]
//! }
//! ```
//! 
//! ## Related Keys
//! 
//! - `param` - Basic search parameters for the compartment resource
//! - `code` - Resource type code for which the parameters apply
//! - `resource` - Array of resource definitions within the compartment
//! - `documentation` - Human-readable description of the compartment
//!

    /// # purpose
    /// 
    /// ## Description
    /// 
    /// The `purpose` attribute provides an explanation of why a FHIR resource
    /// exists and what it is intended to accomplish. This element goes beyond
    /// the technical description to articulate the clinical, business, or
    /// regulatory rationale for the resource's creation and use. The purpose
    /// helps implementers understand the intended context and appropriate
    /// applications for the resource, supporting better decision-making about
    /// adoption and implementation.
    /// 
    /// ## Purpose
    /// 
    /// The `purpose` exists to:
    /// 
    /// - Explain the rationale and intended use cases for FHIR resources
    /// - Provide context for implementers to understand appropriate
    ///   applications
    /// - Support decision-making about resource adoption and implementation
    /// - Document regulatory or business requirements that drove resource
    ///   creation
    /// - Enable better resource discovery and selection for specific use cases
    /// - Facilitate understanding of resource scope and boundaries
    /// - Support governance and compliance requirements for resource usage
    /// 
    /// ## Usage
    /// 
    /// Use the `purpose` attribute when:
    /// 
    /// - Publishing canonical resources like StructureDefinitions, ValueSets,
    ///   or CodeSystems
    /// - Creating implementation guides that need clear use case documentation
    /// - Supporting regulatory submissions that require rationale documentation
    /// - Enabling resource discovery and selection processes
    /// - Providing guidance for implementers about appropriate resource usage
    /// - Documenting business or clinical requirements that justify resource
    ///   creation
    /// - Supporting governance processes that require purpose documentation
    /// 
    /// The purpose should be clear, concise, and focused on the "why" rather
    /// than the "what" or "how".
    /// 
    /// ## Data Type
    /// 
    /// **markdown** - Formatted text supporting Markdown syntax:
    /// 
    /// - Supports rich text formatting including lists, emphasis, and links
    /// - Should be concise but comprehensive enough to explain the rationale
    /// - May include references to regulatory requirements or clinical
    ///   guidelines
    /// - Can use formatting to improve readability and organization
    /// - Should avoid overly technical jargon when possible
    /// - May include examples or scenarios to illustrate intended use
    /// 
    /// ## Constraints
    /// 
    /// - **Required**: Optional but strongly recommended for canonical
    ///   resources
    /// - **Cardinality**: 0..1 (at most one purpose statement per resource)
    /// - **Length**: Should be substantial enough to explain rationale but
    ///   concise for readability
    /// - **Format**: Markdown text that renders appropriately in documentation
    ///   systems
    /// - **Language**: Should match the language specified in the resource
    /// - **Clarity**: Should be understandable to the target audience of
    ///   implementers
    /// - **Accuracy**: Should accurately reflect the actual intended use and
    ///   rationale
    /// 
    /// ## Examples
    /// 
    /// See the accompanying `example.json` file for complete resources
    /// demonstrating purpose usage in various FHIR resources including
    /// StructureDefinitions, ValueSets, and ImplementationGuides with clear
    /// rationale statements.

    ///   with "what" information
    /// - `title` - Human-readable name that should align with the stated

    /// # valueSet
    /// 
    /// ## Description
    /// 
    /// The `valueSet` attribute references another ValueSet resource to include
    /// or exclude its contents in the current ValueSet composition. It enables
    /// modular value set construction by allowing one value set to incorporate
    /// concepts from other value sets, supporting reusable terminology building
    /// blocks and hierarchical value set organization. This promotes
    /// consistency and reduces duplication across related value sets.
    /// 
    /// ## Purpose
    /// 
    /// The `valueSet` exists to enable modular value set composition that
    /// supports:
    /// 
    /// - Reusable terminology building blocks and components
    /// - Hierarchical organization of related value sets
    /// - Consistent concept grouping across multiple value sets
    /// - Reduced maintenance overhead through shared components
    /// - Flexible composition patterns for complex terminology requirements
    /// - Support for organizational and domain-specific value set libraries
    /// 
    /// ## Usage
    /// 
    /// Use the `valueSet` attribute when:
    /// 
    /// - Including concepts from other value sets in your composition
    /// - Building hierarchical value set structures
    /// - Creating modular terminology components for reuse
    /// - Excluding concepts that are defined in other value sets
    /// - Implementing organizational value set inheritance patterns
    /// - Supporting complex terminology requirements through composition
    /// 
    /// ValueSet references are resolved during expansion to incorporate the
    /// referenced concepts.
    /// 
    /// ## Data Type
    /// 
    /// **canonical** - A canonical URL reference to another ValueSet resource:
    /// 
    /// - Must be a valid canonical URL format
    /// - Should resolve to an accessible ValueSet resource
    /// - May include version information using the |version syntax
    /// - Can reference value sets in the same system or external systems
    /// 
    /// ## Constraints
    /// 
    /// - **Required**: URI is required when valueSet is present
    /// - **Cardinality**: 0..* (zero to many occurrences within
    ///   include/exclude)
    /// - **Resolution**: Referenced value sets must be resolvable during
    ///   expansion
    /// - **Circular References**: Must not create circular reference patterns
    /// - **Version Consistency**: Version references should align with
    ///   available versions
    /// - **Access**: Referenced value sets must be accessible to the
    ///   terminology server
    /// 
    /// ## Examples
    /// 
    /// See the accompanying `example.json` file for a complete ValueSet
    /// resource demonstrating the `valueSet` attribute with multiple
    /// references, versioned references, and modular composition patterns.
    /// 
    /// ## Related Keys
