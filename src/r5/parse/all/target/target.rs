//! # target
//! 
//! ## Description
//! 
//! The `target` property specifies the allowed resource types that can be
//! referenced by a reference-type element or search parameter. It constrains
//! which resource types are valid targets for references.
//! 
//! ## Purpose
//! 
//! - Define allowed target resource types for references
//! - Constrain reference relationships between resources
//! - Enable validation of reference integrity
//! - Support type-specific reference processing
//! - Guide client reference resolution behavior
//! 
//! ## Usage
//! 
//! The `target` property is used in SearchParameter definitions,
//! StructureDefinition elements, and other contexts where reference types need
//! to be constrained to specific resource types.
//! 
//! ## Data Type
//! 
//! **code** - Array of resource type codes
//! 
//! ## Constraints
//! 
//! - Must contain valid FHIR resource type names
//! - Should be consistent with the reference element's purpose
//! - Empty array means no specific target constraints
//! - Should be implementable by the server
//! - Must align with business rules and use cases
//! 
//! ## Examples
//! 
//! ### Search Parameter Target Types
//! 
//! ```json
//! {
//!   "resourceType": "SearchParameter",
//!   "name": "patient",
//!   "type": "reference",
//!   "target": [
//!     "Patient"
//!   ]
//! }
//! ```
//! 
//! ### Multiple Target Types
//! 
//! ```json
//! {
//!   "name": "performer",
//!   "type": "reference", 
//!   "target": [
//!     "Practitioner",
//!     "PractitionerRole",
//!     "Organization",
//!     "Patient",
//!     "RelatedPerson"
//!   ]
//! }
//! ```

    /// ## Description
    /// 
    /// The `code` attribute represents a coded value that identifies a specific
    /// concept from a terminology system. It is a fundamental building block in
    /// FHIR R5 for representing standardized concepts and is commonly used
    /// within CodeableConcept and Coding data types to provide machine-readable
    /// identifiers for clinical and administrative concepts.
    /// 
    /// ## Purpose
    /// 
    /// The `code` exists to provide standardized, machine-readable identifiers
    /// for concepts across healthcare systems. This enables:
    /// 
    /// - Interoperability between different healthcare systems
    /// - Consistent representation of clinical concepts
    /// - Support for clinical decision support and analytics
    /// - Mapping between different terminology systems
    /// - Precise semantic meaning in healthcare data exchange
    /// 
    /// ## Usage
    /// 
    /// Use the `code` attribute when:
    /// 
    /// - Representing a specific concept from a code system (diagnoses,
    ///   procedures, medications)
    /// - Creating CodeableConcept or Coding structures
    /// - Implementing standardized vocabularies (ICD-10, SNOMED CT, LOINC)
    /// - Ensuring semantic interoperability between systems
    /// - Supporting automated processing and clinical decision support
    /// 
    /// The `code` should always be paired with a `system` that identifies the
    /// terminology from which the code is drawn.
    /// 
    /// ## Data Type
    /// 
    /// **string** - A sequence of characters representing the identifier within
    /// a code system:
    /// 
    /// - Case sensitivity depends on the code system definition
    /// - Length and format constraints are defined by the specific terminology
    ///   system
    /// - May contain alphanumeric characters, hyphens, periods, and other
    ///   characters as allowed by the system
    /// - Should not contain leading or trailing whitespace
    /// 
    /// ## Constraints
    /// 
    /// - **Required**: Conditional - Required when used within a Coding,
    ///   optional in CodeableConcept when only text is provided
    /// - **Cardinality**: 0..1 (zero to one occurrence within a Coding)
    /// - **Format**: Must conform to the code format rules of the specified
    ///   system
    /// - **Validation**: Should be a valid code in the specified system
    /// - **Case Sensitivity**: Follows the case sensitivity rules of the code

    /// official textual description that corresponds to a specific code within
    /// its system context, helping users understand the meaning of coded values
    /// without requiring deep knowledge of the underlying terminology.
    /// 
    /// ## Purpose

    /// The `relationship` property defines the type of relationship between
    /// entities, resources, or concepts. It specifies how one element relates
    /// to another, supporting various relationship semantics in FHIR resources.
    /// 
    /// ## Purpose
    /// 
    /// - Define semantic relationships between resources or entities
    /// - Specify the nature of connections and associations
    /// - Support relationship-based queries and navigation
