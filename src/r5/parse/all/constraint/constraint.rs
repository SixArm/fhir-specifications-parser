//! # constraint
//! 
//! ## Description
//! 
//! The `constraint` attribute defines validation rules that must be satisfied
//! for a FHIR resource or element to be considered valid. It specifies business
//! rules, invariants, and additional validation logic beyond what is captured
//! by the basic element definitions, ensuring data integrity and consistency
//! across FHIR implementations. Each constraint contains a unique key, severity
//! level, human-readable description, and an executable expression that defines
//! the validation logic.
//! 
//! ## Purpose
//! 
//! The `constraint` exists to ensure data quality and business rule compliance
//! by:
//! 
//! - Defining custom validation rules beyond basic data type constraints
//! - Enforcing business logic and clinical safety requirements
//! - Supporting regulatory compliance and quality assurance
//! - Enabling consistent data validation across different systems
//! - Providing clear error messages when validation fails
//! - Supporting complex inter-element validation scenarios
//! - Facilitating automated quality checks and data governance
//! 
//! ## Usage
//! 
//! Use the `constraint` attribute when:
//! 
//! - Defining business rules that must be enforced during validation
//! - Creating custom validation logic for profiles or extensions
//! - Enforcing clinical safety requirements and best practices
//! - Implementing regulatory or organizational compliance rules
//! - Validating complex relationships between multiple elements
//! - Supporting quality assurance and data governance initiatives
//! - Providing meaningful validation feedback to users
//! 
//! Each constraint includes a unique key for identification, severity level,
//! human-readable description, and executable expression.
//! 
//! ## Data Type
//! 
//! **BackboneElement** - A complex structure containing:
//! 
//! - **key** (id) - Unique identifier for the constraint
//! - **requirements** (markdown) - Why the constraint is needed
//! - **severity** (code) - error, warning, or guideline
//! - **human** (string) - Human-readable description
//! - **expression** (string) - FHIRPath expression defining the rule
//! - **xpath** (string) - XPath equivalent (deprecated)
//! - **source** (canonical) - Source of the constraint definition
//! 
//! ## Constraints
//! 
//! - **Required**: No - Only needed when custom validation rules are required
//! - **Cardinality**: 0..* (zero to many constraints per element)
//! - **Unique Keys**: Each constraint key must be unique within the structure
//! - **Expression Format**: Must be valid FHIRPath or equivalent expression
//!   language
//! - **Severity Values**: Must be one of: error, warning, guideline
//! - **Inheritance**: Derived profiles inherit constraints from base
//!   definitions
//! - **Source Specification**: Source should reference the defining
//!   specification
//! 
//! ## Examples
//! 
//! See the accompanying `example.json` file for complete StructureDefinition
//! resources demonstrating various constraint patterns including clinical
//! safety rules, business logic validation, regulatory compliance checks, and
//! quality assurance constraints.
//! 
//! ## Related Keys
//! 
//! - `key` - Unique identifier within the constraint definition
//! - `severity` - Level of constraint enforcement (error, warning, guideline)
//! - `human` - Human-readable description of the constraint
//! - `expression` - Executable validation logic using FHIRPath
//! - `condition` - Conditions that must be met for elements to be present
//! - `min` - Minimum cardinality constraints on elements
//! - `max` - Maximum cardinality constraints on elements
//! 
//! ## Specification Reference
//! 
//! Based on FHIR R5 specification. For complete details, refer to the official
//! FHIR R5 documentation for ElementDefinition constraints and validation
//! principles.
