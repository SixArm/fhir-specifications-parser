//! # type
//! 
//! ## Description
//! 
//! The `type` attribute is used throughout FHIR R5 to specify the category,
//! classification, or specific kind of an element or resource. It provides
//! essential context that determines how data should be interpreted, processed,
//! or displayed, and often drives business logic and workflow decisions within
//! healthcare systems.
//! 
//! ## Purpose
//! 
//! The `type` exists to provide categorization and context for FHIR elements,
//! enabling:
//! 
//! - Classification of data elements into meaningful categories
//! - Support for polymorphic data structures and processing
//! - Workflow and business logic decision-making
//! - Appropriate rendering and user interface behavior
//! - Filtering and querying based on type classifications
//! 
//! ## Usage
//! 
//! Use the `type` attribute when:
//! 
//! - Classifying identifiers (MRN, SSN, driver's license, etc.)
//! - Specifying communication methods (phone, email, fax)
//! - Categorizing addresses (home, work, temporary)
//! - Defining contact relationships (emergency contact, next of kin)
//! - Classifying observations, procedures, or other clinical data
//! - Specifying reference types in resource relationships
//! 
//! The type often uses standardized code systems to ensure consistency and
//! interoperability.
//! 
//! ## Data Type
//! 
//! **CodeableConcept** - Typically a coded value that may include:
//! 
//! - `coding` - Array of coded representations from standard terminologies
//! - `text` - Human-readable description of the type
//! - Support for multiple coding systems for the same concept
//! - Fallback to text when no appropriate code exists
//! 
//! ## Constraints
//! 
//! - **Required**: Conditional - depends on the specific context and use case
//! - **Cardinality**: Usually 0..1, sometimes 0..* for multiple type
//!   classifications
//! - **Binding Strength**: Often bound to specific value sets with varying
//!   strength
//! - **Consistency**: Should align with established terminology standards
//! - **Context Dependency**: Meaning may vary based on the containing element
//! 
//! ## Examples
//! 
//! See the accompanying `example.json` file for a complete Patient resource
//! demonstrating various uses of the `type` attribute across different
//! elements.
//! 
//! ## Related Keys
//! 
//! - `system` - URI identifying the code system used in type coding
//! - `code` - Specific identifier within the type's code system
//! - `display` - Human-readable representation of the type
//! - `use` - Usage context that may complement type information
//! - `category` - Higher-level classification that may contain type
//! 
//! ## Specification Reference
//! 
//! Based on FHIR R5 specification. For complete details, refer to the official
//! FHIR R5 documentation for specific element type bindings, CodeableConcept
//! usage, and terminology binding requirements.

    /// # extension
    /// 
    /// ## Description
    /// 
    /// The `extension` attribute provides a mechanism for extending FHIR
    /// resources with additional data elements that are not part of the base
    /// resource definition. Extensions allow for local customizations and the
    /// addition of new data elements while maintaining interoperability in FHIR
    /// R5.
    /// 
    /// ## Purpose
    /// 
    /// Extensions exist to:
    /// 
    /// - Add data elements not covered by the base FHIR specification
    /// - Support local, regional, or national requirements
    /// - Enable gradual evolution of FHIR without breaking existing
    ///   implementations
    /// - Maintain semantic interoperability through standardized extension
    ///   definitions
    /// - Allow for experimental or emerging data requirements
    /// - Support backwards compatibility when new elements are added to FHIR
    /// 
    /// ## Usage
    /// 
    /// Use extensions when you need to:
    /// 
    /// - Include additional data not supported by standard FHIR elements
    /// - Implement local business requirements
    /// - Support regulatory or compliance requirements
    /// - Add experimental data elements before they become part of core FHIR
    /// - Extend resources with organization-specific information
    /// 
    /// Extensions should always reference a StructureDefinition that defines
    /// their meaning and constraints.
    /// 
    /// ## Data Type
    /// 
    /// **Extension** - A complex data type containing:
    /// 
    /// - `url` (required): canonical URI identifying the extension definition
    /// - `value[x]` (optional): the actual extension value using one of the
    ///   allowed FHIR data types
    /// - `extension` (optional): nested extensions for complex extension
    ///   structures
    /// 
    /// Extensions can be simple (single value) or complex (containing nested
    /// extensions).
    /// 
    /// ## Constraints
    /// 
    /// - **Required**: No - Extensions are always optional
    /// - **Cardinality**: 0..* (zero to many occurrences)
    /// - **URL Required**: Every extension must have a `url` that references
    ///   its definition
    /// - **Value or Nested**: Extensions must have either a value or nested
    ///   extensions, not both
    /// - **Definition**: The URL must reference a valid StructureDefinition of
    ///   type Extension
    /// - **Placement**: Can appear on any element that allows extensions
    /// 
    /// ## Examples
    /// 
    /// See the accompanying `example.json` file for a complete Patient resource
    /// demonstrating various types of extensions including simple value
    /// extensions and complex nested extensions.
    /// 
    /// ## Related Keys
    /// 
    /// - `modifierExtension` - Extensions that modify the meaning of the
    ///   element
    /// - `url` - Required sub-element identifying the extension
    /// - `value[x]` - The extension's value using FHIR data types
    /// - Any FHIR element can contain extensions
    /// 
    /// ## Specification Reference

    /// # code
    /// 
    /// ## Description
    /// 
    /// The `code` attribute represents a coded value that identifies a specific
    /// concept from a terminology system. It is a fundamental building block in
    /// FHIR R5 for representing standardized concepts and is commonly used
    /// within CodeableConcept and Coding data types to provide machine-readable
    /// identifiers for clinical and administrative concepts.
    /// 
    /// ## Purpose
    /// 
    /// The `code` exists to provide standardized, machine-readable identifiers
    /// for concepts across healthcare systems. This enables:
    /// 
    /// - Interoperability between different healthcare systems
    /// - Consistent representation of clinical concepts
    /// - Support for clinical decision support and analytics
    /// - Mapping between different terminology systems
    /// - Precise semantic meaning in healthcare data exchange
    /// 
    /// ## Usage
    /// 
    /// Use the `code` attribute when:
    /// 
    /// - Representing a specific concept from a code system (diagnoses,
    ///   procedures, medications)
    /// - Creating CodeableConcept or Coding structures
    /// - Implementing standardized vocabularies (ICD-10, SNOMED CT, LOINC)
    /// - Ensuring semantic interoperability between systems
    /// - Supporting automated processing and clinical decision support
    /// 
    /// The `code` should always be paired with a `system` that identifies the
    /// terminology from which the code is drawn.
    /// 
    /// ## Data Type
    /// 
    /// **string** - A sequence of characters representing the identifier within
    /// a code system:
    /// 
    /// - Case sensitivity depends on the code system definition
    /// - Length and format constraints are defined by the specific terminology
    ///   system
    /// - May contain alphanumeric characters, hyphens, periods, and other
    ///   characters as allowed by the system
    /// - Should not contain leading or trailing whitespace
    /// 
    /// ## Constraints
    /// 
    /// - **Required**: Conditional - Required when used within a Coding,
    ///   optional in CodeableConcept when only text is provided
    /// - **Cardinality**: 0..1 (zero to one occurrence within a Coding)
    /// - **Format**: Must conform to the code format rules of the specified
    ///   system
    /// - **Validation**: Should be a valid code in the specified system
    /// - **Case Sensitivity**: Follows the case sensitivity rules of the code
    ///   system
    /// 
    /// ## Examples
    /// 
    /// See the accompanying `example.json` file for a complete Observation
    /// resource demonstrating various uses of the `code` attribute in different
    /// contexts.
