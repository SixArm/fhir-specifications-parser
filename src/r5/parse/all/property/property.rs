//! # property
//! 
//! ## Description
//! 
//! The `property` attribute defines additional properties and metadata
//! associated with concepts in a CodeSystem. It provides structured information
//! about concepts beyond the basic code, display, and definition, enabling rich
//! semantic descriptions and supporting complex terminology operations.
//! Properties can represent various aspects of concepts including
//! relationships, classifications, and computational attributes.
//! 
//! ## Purpose
//! 
//! The `property` exists to provide extensible concept metadata that enables:
//! 
//! - Rich semantic descriptions of terminology concepts
//! - Support for complex terminology relationships and hierarchies
//! - Computational attributes for terminology operations
//! - Classification and categorization information
//! - Version and lifecycle management of concepts
//! - Integration with external terminology systems and standards
//! 
//! ## Usage
//! 
//! Use the `property` attribute when:
//! 
//! - Defining concept metadata beyond basic identification
//! - Implementing hierarchical relationships between concepts
//! - Supporting advanced terminology operations and filtering
//! - Providing classification and categorization information
//! - Enabling computational processing of concepts
//! - Supporting concept lifecycle and version management
//! 
//! Properties are defined at the CodeSystem level and assigned values at the
//! concept level.
//! 
//! ## Data Type
//! 
//! **BackboneElement** - Property definition (at CodeSystem level):
//! 
//! - `code` (code) - Identifies the property
//! - `uri` (uri) - Formal identifier for the property
//! - `description` (string) - Description of the property
//! - `type` (code) - Data type (code, Coding, string, integer, boolean,
//!   dateTime, decimal)
//! 
//! **BackboneElement** - Property value (at concept level):
//! 
//! - `code` (code) - Identifies which property
//! - `value[x]` - The property value (type determined by property definition)
//! 
//! ## Constraints
//! 
//! - **Required**: Code is required for both property definitions and values
//! - **Cardinality**: 0..* (zero to many occurrences)
//! - **Type Consistency**: Property values must match the defined type
//! - **Code Uniqueness**: Property codes should be unique within a CodeSystem
//! - **URI Uniqueness**: Property URIs should be globally unique when present
//! - **Value Validation**: Property values should conform to their defined
//!   constraints
//! 
//! ## Examples
//! 
//! See the accompanying `example.json` file for a complete CodeSystem resource
//! demonstrating the `property` attribute with various property types,
//! relationships, and concept-level property values.
//! 
//! ## Related Keys
//! 
//! - `code` - Identifier for the property or concept
//! - `uri` - Formal URI identifier for the property
//! - `type` - Data type of property values
//! - `value[x]` - Property value with type-specific suffix
//! - `concept` - Parent concept containing property values
//! - `description` - Human-readable property description
//! - `filter` - Related element that can reference properties
//! 
//! ## Specification Reference
//! 
//! Based on FHIR R5 specification. For complete details, refer to the official
//! FHIR R5 documentation for CodeSystem resource and concept property
//! definitions.

    /// 
    /// The `code` attribute represents a coded value that identifies a specific
    /// concept from a terminology system. It is a fundamental building block in
    /// FHIR R5 for representing standardized concepts and is commonly used
    /// within CodeableConcept and Coding data types to provide machine-readable
    /// identifiers for clinical and administrative concepts.
    /// 
    /// ## Purpose
    /// 
    /// The `code` exists to provide standardized, machine-readable identifiers
    /// for concepts across healthcare systems. This enables:
    /// - Interoperability between different healthcare systems
    /// - Consistent representation of clinical concepts
    /// - Support for clinical decision support and analytics
    /// - Mapping between different terminology systems
    /// - Precise semantic meaning in healthcare data exchange

    /// - Implementing standardized vocabularies (ICD-10, SNOMED CT, LOINC)
    /// - Ensuring semantic interoperability between systems
    /// - Supporting automated processing and clinical decision support

    ///   system
    /// - May contain alphanumeric characters, hyphens, periods, and other
    ///   characters as allowed by the system
    /// - Should not contain leading or trailing whitespace
    /// 
    /// ## Constraints
    /// 
    /// - **Required**: Conditional - Required when used within a Coding,

    /// ## Description
    /// 
    /// The `type` attribute is used throughout FHIR R5 to specify the category,
