//! # coding
//! 
//! ## Description
//! 
//! The `coding` attribute is an array that contains one or more
//! code/system/display triplets representing the same concept from different
//! terminology systems. It is a core component of the CodeableConcept data type
//! in FHIR R5, enabling multiple representations of the same clinical concept
//! using different coding systems for maximum interoperability.
//! 
//! ## Purpose
//! 
//! The `coding` exists to provide multiple coded representations of a single
//! concept, supporting:
//! 
//! - Cross-terminology mapping and translation
//! - System interoperability across different coding standards
//! - Fallback options when primary codes are not understood
//! - Support for local and international terminology systems
//! - Semantic equivalence across different healthcare contexts
//! 
//! ## Usage
//! 
//! Use the `coding` attribute when:
//! 
//! - Creating CodeableConcept structures with multiple code representations
//! - Mapping between different terminology systems (e.g., ICD-10 to SNOMED CT)
//! - Providing both local and standard codes for the same concept
//! - Supporting systems that may understand different coding systems
//! - Ensuring maximum interoperability in data exchange
//! 
//! Each coding entry should represent the same concept but from different
//! terminology systems or versions.
//! 
//! ## Data Type
//! 
//! **array of Coding** - An array containing Coding objects, where each Coding
//! contains:
//! 
//! - `system` (string): URI identifying the code system
//! - `code` (string): Symbol in syntax defined by the system
//! - `display` (string): Representation defined by the system
//! - `version` (string): Version of the system (optional)
//! - `userSelected` (boolean): Whether this coding was chosen by the user
//! 
//! ## Constraints
//! 
//! - **Required**: Conditional - Required in CodeableConcept when no text is
//!   provided
//! - **Cardinality**: 0..* (zero to many occurrences)
//! - **Uniqueness**: Each coding should represent equivalent concepts from
//!   different systems
//! - **System Requirements**: Each coding should have a system URI
//! - **Order**: Generally ordered by preference or specificity
//! 
//! ## Examples
//! 
//! See the accompanying `example.json` file for a complete MedicationRequest
//! resource demonstrating the use of the `coding` attribute with multiple
//! terminology systems.
//! 
//! ## Related Keys
//! 
//! - `code` - The specific identifier within each coding
//! - `system` - The terminology system URI for each coding
//! - `display` - Human-readable text for each coding
//! - `text` - Free text representation of the overall concept
//! - `userSelected` - Indicates user preference among multiple codings
//! 
//! ## Specification Reference
//! 
//! Based on FHIR R5 specification. For complete details, refer to the official
//! FHIR R5 documentation for CodeableConcept and Coding data types, and
//! terminology binding guidance.

    /// This version works in conjunction with the canonical `url` to provide

    /// organizational conventions.
    ///
    /// ## Data Type
