    /// # resourceType
    /// 
    /// ## Description
    /// 
    /// The `resourceType` attribute specifies the type of FHIR resource being
    /// represented. It is a mandatory element that identifies which resource
    /// schema and constraints apply to the JSON document in FHIR R5.
    /// 
    /// ## Purpose
    /// 
    /// The `resourceType` serves several critical functions:
    /// 
    /// - Identifies the specific FHIR resource type for parsers and processors
    /// - Determines which validation rules and constraints apply
    /// - Enables proper routing and processing in FHIR systems
    /// - Provides context for interpreting the resource's data elements
    /// - Supports polymorphism in FHIR resource handling
    /// 
    /// ## Usage
    /// 
    /// The `resourceType` must be included in every FHIR resource as the first
    /// element. It should be used:
    /// 
    /// - At the root level of every FHIR resource JSON document
    /// - When validating resources against their appropriate
    ///   StructureDefinitions
    /// - In API endpoints to determine resource-specific processing logic
    /// - For content negotiation and resource type filtering
    /// 
    /// ## Data Type
    /// 
    /// **code** - A string that must exactly match one of the defined FHIR
    /// resource types. The value is:
    /// 
    /// - Case-sensitive
    /// - Must be an exact match to a valid FHIR R5 resource type name
    /// - Follows PascalCase naming convention (e.g., "Patient", "Observation",
    ///   "DiagnosticReport")
    /// 
    /// ## Constraints
    /// 
    /// - **Required**: Yes - Must be present in every FHIR resource
    /// - **Cardinality**: 1..1 (exactly one occurrence)
    /// - **Fixed Position**: Must be the first element in the JSON object
    /// - **Valid Values**: Must be one of the 150+ defined FHIR R5 resource
    ///   types
    /// - **Case Sensitivity**: Exact case match required
    /// 
    /// ## Examples
    /// 
    /// See the accompanying `example.json` file for a complete Observation
    /// resource demonstrating the use of the `resourceType` attribute.
    /// 
    /// ## Related Keys
    /// 
    /// - `meta.profile` - Specifies which profile(s) the resource conforms to
    /// - `id` - Unique identifier for the resource instance
    /// - `meta` - Metadata about the resource
    /// - All resource-specific elements depend on the `resourceType` for their
    ///   validity

    /// 
    /// The `id` attribute is the logical identifier for a FHIR resource within
    /// a given context. It uniquely identifies the resource and is used for
    /// resource addressing and referencing within FHIR R5.
    /// 
    /// ## Purpose
    /// 
    /// The `id` exists to provide a unique identifier for each FHIR resource
    /// instance. This identifier is essential for:
    /// 
    /// - Resource addressing via RESTful URLs
    /// - Creating references between resources
    /// - Version control and resource tracking
    /// - Enabling resource updates and deletions
    /// 
    /// ## Usage
    /// 
    /// Use the `id` attribute when:
    /// 
    /// - Creating a new resource that needs to be uniquely identifiable
    /// - Referencing a resource from another resource
    /// - Performing CRUD operations on existing resources
    /// - Building RESTful FHIR APIs
    /// 
    /// The `id` is typically assigned by the server when a resource is created,
    /// but can be provided by the client in some scenarios.
    /// 
    /// ## Data Type
    /// 
    /// **string** - A sequence of Unicode characters with the following
    /// constraints:
    /// 
    /// - Must be between 1 and 64 characters in length
    /// - Can contain letters (A-Z, a-z), digits (0-9), hyphens (-), and periods
    ///   (.)
    /// - Must start and end with an alphanumeric character
    /// - Case sensitive
    /// 
    /// ## Constraints
    /// 
    /// - **Required**: No - The `id` is optional for resource creation but
    ///   typically assigned by servers
    /// - **Cardinality**: 0..1 (zero to one occurrence)
    /// - **Length**: 1-64 characters
    /// - **Pattern**: Must match the regex `[A-Za-z0-9\-\.]{1,64}`

    /// ## Description
    /// 
    /// The `type` attribute is used throughout FHIR R5 to specify the category,
    /// classification, or specific kind of an element or resource. It provides
    /// essential context that determines how data should be interpreted,
    /// processed, or displayed, and often drives business logic and workflow
    /// decisions within healthcare systems.
    /// 
    /// ## Purpose
    /// 
    /// The `type` exists to provide categorization and context for FHIR
    /// elements, enabling:
    /// 
    /// - Classification of data elements into meaningful categories
    /// - Support for polymorphic data structures and processing
    /// - Workflow and business logic decision-making
    /// - Appropriate rendering and user interface behavior
    /// - Filtering and querying based on type classifications
    /// 
    /// ## Usage
    /// 
    /// Use the `type` attribute when:
    /// 
    /// - Classifying identifiers (MRN, SSN, driver's license, etc.)
    /// - Specifying communication methods (phone, email, fax)
    /// - Categorizing addresses (home, work, temporary)
    /// - Defining contact relationships (emergency contact, next of kin)
    /// - Classifying observations, procedures, or other clinical data
    /// - Specifying reference types in resource relationships
    /// 
    /// The type often uses standardized code systems to ensure consistency and
    /// interoperability.

    /// ## Data Type
    /// 
    /// **CodeableConcept** - Typically a coded value that may include:
    /// 
    /// - `coding` - Array of coded representations from standard terminologies
    /// - `text` - Human-readable description of the type
    /// - Support for multiple coding systems for the same concept
    /// - Fallback to text when no appropriate code exists
    /// 
    /// ## Constraints
    /// 
    /// - **Required**: Conditional - depends on the specific context and use
    ///   case
    /// - **Cardinality**: Usually 0..1, sometimes 0..* for multiple type
