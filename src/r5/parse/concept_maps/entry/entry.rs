    /// # fullUrl
    /// 
    /// ## Description
    /// 
    /// The `fullUrl` attribute provides an absolute URL that uniquely
    /// identifies a resource within a Bundle entry. This URL serves as a stable
    /// identifier that can be used for references within the bundle and
    /// provides a canonical location where the resource can be found. The
    /// fullUrl is particularly important for maintaining referential integrity
    /// within bundles and supporting resource resolution in distributed
    /// systems.
    /// 
    /// ## Purpose
    /// 
    /// The `fullUrl` exists to:
    /// 
    /// - Provide unique identification for resources within bundle entries
    /// - Support referential integrity and link resolution within bundles
    /// - Enable absolute URL references for resource location and retrieval
    /// - Support bundle processing and resource cross-referencing
    /// - Facilitate resource caching and resolution mechanisms
    /// - Enable proper resource identification in messaging and transaction
    ///   bundles
    /// - Support canonical resource referencing across distributed systems
    /// 
    /// ## Usage
    /// 
    /// Use the `fullUrl` attribute when:
    /// 
    /// - Creating Bundle entries that need unique resource identification
    /// - Supporting internal bundle references between resources
    /// - Implementing resource resolution and caching mechanisms
    /// - Creating transaction or batch bundles with resource interdependencies
    /// - Building messaging bundles with multiple related resources
    /// - Supporting search bundles where resources need canonical URLs
    /// - Implementing resource versioning and history tracking
    /// 
    /// The fullUrl should be globally unique and ideally resolvable to the
    /// actual resource location.
    /// 
    /// ## Data Type
    /// 
    /// **uri** - An absolute Uniform Resource Identifier:
    /// 
    /// - Must be an absolute URI (not relative)
    /// - Should be globally unique within the context
    /// - Commonly uses HTTP/HTTPS scheme for web-accessible resources
    /// - May use URN scheme for non-web identifiers
    /// - Should be stable and persistent when possible
    /// - Must be unique within the containing bundle
    /// - Should follow RFC 3986 URI syntax requirements
    /// 
    /// ## Constraints
    /// 
    /// - **Required**: Optional within bundle entries, but recommended for
    ///   referential integrity
    /// - **Cardinality**: 0..1 (at most one occurrence per entry)
    /// - **Format**: Must be a valid absolute URI
    /// - **Uniqueness**: Must be unique within the containing bundle
    /// - **Resolvability**: Should ideally resolve to the actual resource when
    ///   accessed
    /// - **Stability**: Should remain stable across bundle versions when
    ///   representing the same resource
    /// - **Scheme**: Typically HTTP/HTTPS, but other URI schemes are permitted
    /// 
    /// ## Examples
    /// 
    /// See the accompanying `example.json` file for a complete Bundle resource
    /// demonstrating fullUrl usage in various contexts including search
    /// results, transactions, and messaging with proper cross-referencing.
    /// 
    /// ## Related Keys
    /// 
    /// - `entry` - The bundle entry container that includes the fullUrl
    /// - `resource` - The actual FHIR resource that the fullUrl identifies
    /// - `reference` - Resource references that may use the fullUrl for
    ///   resolution
    /// - `url` - Canonical URLs in resources that may match the fullUrl

    /// 
    /// ## Description
    /// 
    /// The `resource` property defines capabilities and constraints for
    /// specific FHIR resource types in capability statements and other
    /// conformance resources.
    /// 
    /// ## Purpose
    /// 
    /// - Define resource-specific capabilities
    /// - Specify supported operations per resource
    /// - Document resource constraints and profiles
    /// - Enable resource capability discovery
    /// - Support conformance testing
    /// 
    /// ## Usage
    /// 
    /// The `resource` property is used in CapabilityStatement and other
    /// conformance resources to define capabilities for specific resource
    /// types.
    /// 
    /// ## Data Type
    /// 
    /// **BackboneElement** - Complex structure defining resource capabilities

    /// ## Constraints
    /// 
    /// - Must specify valid resource type
    /// - Should define realistic capabilities
    /// - Must align with server implementation
    /// - Should include relevant interactions
    /// 
    /// ## Examples
