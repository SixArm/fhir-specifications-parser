    /// # code
    /// 
    /// ## Description
    /// 
    /// The `code` attribute represents a coded value that identifies a specific
    /// concept from a terminology system. It is a fundamental building block in
    /// FHIR R5 for representing standardized concepts and is commonly used
    /// within CodeableConcept and Coding data types to provide machine-readable
    /// identifiers for clinical and administrative concepts.
    /// 
    /// ## Purpose
    /// 
    /// The `code` exists to provide standardized, machine-readable identifiers
    /// for concepts across healthcare systems. This enables:
    /// 
    /// - Interoperability between different healthcare systems
    /// - Consistent representation of clinical concepts
    /// - Support for clinical decision support and analytics
    /// - Mapping between different terminology systems
    /// - Precise semantic meaning in healthcare data exchange
    /// 
    /// ## Usage
    /// 
    /// Use the `code` attribute when:
    /// 
    /// - Representing a specific concept from a code system (diagnoses,
    ///   procedures, medications)
    /// - Creating CodeableConcept or Coding structures
    /// - Implementing standardized vocabularies (ICD-10, SNOMED CT, LOINC)
    /// - Ensuring semantic interoperability between systems
    /// - Supporting automated processing and clinical decision support
    /// 
    /// The `code` should always be paired with a `system` that identifies the
    /// terminology from which the code is drawn.
    /// 
    /// ## Data Type
    /// 
    /// **string** - A sequence of characters representing the identifier within
    /// a code system:
    /// 
    /// - Case sensitivity depends on the code system definition
    /// - Length and format constraints are defined by the specific terminology
    ///   system
    /// - May contain alphanumeric characters, hyphens, periods, and other
    ///   characters as allowed by the system
    /// - Should not contain leading or trailing whitespace
    /// 
    /// ## Constraints
    /// 
    /// - **Required**: Conditional - Required when used within a Coding,
    ///   optional in CodeableConcept when only text is provided
    /// - **Cardinality**: 0..1 (zero to one occurrence within a Coding)
    /// - **Format**: Must conform to the code format rules of the specified
    ///   system
    /// - **Validation**: Should be a valid code in the specified system
    /// - **Case Sensitivity**: Follows the case sensitivity rules of the code
    ///   system
    /// 
    /// ## Examples
    /// 
    /// See the accompanying `example.json` file for a complete Observation
    /// resource demonstrating various uses of the `code` attribute in different
    /// contexts.
    /// 
    /// ## Related Keys
    /// 
    /// - `system` - URI that identifies the code system containing this code
    /// - `display` - Human-readable representation of the code
    /// - `coding` - Array containing code/system/display triplets
    /// - `text` - Free text representation when no suitable code exists
    /// - `version` - Version of the code system when relevant
    /// 
    /// ## Specification Reference
    /// 
    /// Based on FHIR R5 specification. For complete details, refer to the
    /// official FHIR R5 documentation for Coding and CodeableConcept data
    /// types, and terminology binding principles.

    /// # display
    /// 
    /// ## Description
    /// 
    /// The `display` attribute provides a human-readable representation of a
    /// coded concept as defined by the terminology system. It serves as the
    /// official textual description that corresponds to a specific code within
    /// its system context, helping users understand the meaning of coded values
    /// without requiring deep knowledge of the underlying terminology.
    /// 
    /// ## Purpose
    /// 
    /// The `display` exists to provide human-interpretable text for coded
    /// concepts, enabling:
    /// 
    /// - User-friendly presentation of clinical data
    /// - Verification that the correct code was selected
    /// - Fallback text when terminology services are unavailable
    /// - Consistency with official terminology definitions
    /// - Support for user interfaces and clinical documentation
    /// 
    /// ## Usage
    /// 
    /// Use the `display` attribute when:
    /// 
    /// - Creating Coding structures with human-readable labels
    /// - Providing official terminology descriptions for codes
    /// - Supporting user interfaces that show coded concepts
    /// - Ensuring consistency with terminology system definitions
    /// - Enabling verification of code selection accuracy
    /// 
    /// The display text should match the official definition from the
    /// terminology system and should not be modified or localized arbitrarily.
    /// 
    /// ## Data Type
    /// 
    /// **string** - Human-readable text representing the code:
    /// 
    /// - Should match the official display text from the terminology system
    /// - Case sensitivity follows the terminology system rules
    /// - Should be concise but descriptive
    /// - May include additional context as defined by the system
    /// - Should not contain markup or special formatting
    /// 
    /// ## Constraints
    /// 
    /// - **Required**: No - Optional but strongly recommended for usability
    /// - **Cardinality**: 0..1 (zero to one occurrence within a Coding)
    /// - **Accuracy**: Should match the official terminology system definition
    /// - **Language**: Typically in the language specified by the terminology
    ///   system
    /// - **Consistency**: Should be stable for a given code/system combination
    /// 
    /// ## Examples
    /// 
    /// See the accompanying `example.json` file for a complete Condition
    /// resource demonstrating the use of the `display` attribute across various
    /// coded fields.
    ///

    /// - `system` - The terminology system that defines both code and display
    /// - `text` - Free-text description that may differ from official display
    /// - `designation` - Alternative representations in different
    ///   languages/contexts
    /// - `coding` - Contains the display along with code and system

    /// # target
    /// 
    /// ## Description
    /// 
    /// The `target` property specifies the allowed resource types that can be
    /// referenced by a reference-type element or search parameter. It
    /// constrains which resource types are valid targets for references.
    /// 
    /// ## Purpose
    /// 
    /// - Define allowed target resource types for references
    /// - Constrain reference relationships between resources
    /// - Enable validation of reference integrity
    /// - Support type-specific reference processing
    /// - Guide client reference resolution behavior
    /// 
    /// ## Usage
    /// 
    /// The `target` property is used in SearchParameter definitions,
    /// StructureDefinition elements, and other contexts where reference types
    /// need to be constrained to specific resource types.
    /// 
    /// ## Data Type
    /// 
    /// **code** - Array of resource type codes
    /// 
    /// ## Constraints
    /// 
    /// - Must contain valid FHIR resource type names
    /// - Should be consistent with the reference element's purpose
    /// - Empty array means no specific target constraints
    /// - Should be implementable by the server
    /// - Must align with business rules and use cases
