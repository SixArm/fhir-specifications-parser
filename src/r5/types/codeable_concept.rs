    /// # text
    /// 
    /// ## Description
    /// 
    /// The `text` attribute provides a human-readable narrative summary of a
    /// FHIR resource's content in XHTML format. This narrative serves as a
    /// fallback representation that ensures the essential information remains
    /// accessible even when systems cannot process all the structured data
    /// elements. The text element is particularly important for clinical
    /// safety, regulatory compliance, and systems interoperability where human
    /// readability is required.
    /// 
    /// ## Purpose
    /// 
    /// The `text` exists to:
    /// 
    /// - Provide human-readable summaries of structured resource content
    /// - Ensure clinical information remains accessible when structured data
    ///   cannot be processed
    /// - Support regulatory requirements for human-readable clinical documents
    /// - Enable fallback display when rendering systems have limited
    ///   capabilities
    /// - Provide narrative context that complements structured data
    /// - Support clinical safety by ensuring critical information is always
    ///   readable
    /// - Enable content review and validation by healthcare professionals
    /// 
    /// ## Usage
    /// 
    /// Use the `text` attribute when:
    /// 
    /// - Creating clinical resources that require human-readable summaries
    /// - Supporting regulatory compliance for clinical documentation
    /// - Ensuring accessibility across diverse healthcare systems
    /// - Providing narrative context for complex structured data
    /// - Creating resources for patient-facing applications
    /// - Supporting clinical review workflows that need readable content
    /// - Implementing systems that require both structured and narrative
    ///   representations
    /// 
    /// The narrative should accurately summarize the key information from the
    /// structured elements.
    /// 
    /// ## Data Type
    /// 
    /// **Narrative** - A complex structure containing:
    /// 
    /// - `status` (code): The generation status of the narrative
    ///   (generated|extensions|additional|empty)
    /// - `div` (xhtml): The XHTML content of the narrative
    /// 
    /// **Status Values:**
    /// 
    /// - `generated`: Generated from structured data, no additional information
    /// - `extensions`: Generated from structured data with additional extension
    ///   content
    /// - `additional`: Contains additional information not in structured data
    /// - `empty`: No narrative content provided
    /// 
    /// ## Constraints
    /// 
    /// - **Required**: Optional but strongly recommended for most clinical
    ///   resources
    /// - **Cardinality**: 0..1 (at most one narrative per resource)
    /// - **XHTML Format**: The div element must contain valid XHTML content
    /// - **Safety**: Should include all critical information from structured
    ///   data
    /// - **Consistency**: Should accurately reflect the structured data content
    /// - **Language**: Should match the language specified in the resource
    /// - **Security**: XHTML content must be safe and not contain executable
    ///   scripts
    /// 
    /// ## Examples
    /// 
    /// See the accompanying `example.json` file for complete resources
    /// demonstrating text narratives for different resource types including
    /// clinical observations, medications, and patient information.
    /// 
    /// ## Related Keys
    /// 
    /// - `div` - The XHTML content portion of the narrative
    /// - `status` - Indicates how the narrative was generated and its
    ///   relationship to structured data
    /// - `language` - Language code that may affect narrative content
    /// - `meta` - Resource metadata that may influence narrative generation
    /// - `contained` - Inline resources that may be referenced in the narrative
    /// - `extension` - Extensions that may be included in "extensions" status
    ///   narratives
    /// 
    /// ## Specification Reference
    /// 
    /// Based on FHIR R5 specification. For complete details, refer to the
    /// official FHIR R5 documentation for Narrative data type and narrative
    /// generation requirements.
